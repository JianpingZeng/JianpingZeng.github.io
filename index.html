<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>
I am a computer architect at Samsung Memory Solutions Lab (MSL), USA with a
Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Purdue University where I was fortunately
advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/chjung/">Changhee
Jung</a>.  In the meanwhile, I also closely work with Prof. <a
href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~dongyoon/">Dongyoon Lee</a> at Stony
Brook University, Prof. <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tcarlson/">Trevor
E. Carlson</a> at National University of Singapore, and Prof. <a
href="https://jongouk-choi.github.io/jongouk/">Jongouk Choi</a> at University
of Central Florida. Prior to joining Purdue University, I worked as a compiler
engineer with focuses on optimizing the middle-end and backend of GCC (GNU
Compiler Collection) for CSKY architecture (an embedded architecture widely
used in network switch, printer, etc) of
<a href="https://www.t-head.cn/?lang=en">Alibaba T-Head Semiconductor</a>. I
obtained my Master degree from <a href="http://cs.hust.edu.cn/">School of
Computer Science of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST),
China</a>.</p>

<p>
My research interests generally lie in designing more reliable and performant
computing systems, including server-class systems and embedded systems, against
soft errors and crash consistency issues resulting from power failures.  To
achieve that, I usually co-design compilers and architectures to maintain
minimal hardware complexity while achieving high performance. My research works
are typically published at top-tier system venues, e.g., ISCA, MICRO, ICS, PLDI,
HPDC, and RTSS.

   <li>
	 <b>Research Intern: May 2023-August 2023, Samsung Memory Solutions Lab (MSL) managed by Dr. Yang Seok Ki.</b></br>
     I interned at Samsung MSL to design a more energy-efficiency ECC DRAM while maintaining its reliability.
	 </li>
   <li>
	 <b>Research Intern: May 2022-August 2022, Alibaba DAMO Academy, Computing
	 Technology Lab directed by Prof. <a href="https://seal.ece.ucsb.edu/people/yuan-xie">Yuan Xie</a>. </b></br>
	 I worked on optimizing the ARM memory fence instructions, which is
	 particular of importance for the server cores scaling up to 256 cores. This is
	 because ARM processor is now prevalent in server fleets due to its energy-efficiency
	 and low license cost. However, the memory fences, highly affecting the performance
	 of multi-threaded applications, on ARM cores are not optimized in contemporary
     ARM server processors.
  </li>

  <li>
   <b>Senior Compiler Engineer: Dec 2017-July 2018, Alibaba T-Head Semiconductor. </b></br>
	 After obtaining my Master degree from HUST, I worked at Alibaba T-Head as a
	 senior compiler engineer with the focus on analyzing and uncovering the
	 performance bottleneck of GCC for CSKY architecture in terms of run-time
	 performance and code size. What I did is fixing a series of performance bugs
	 of GCC for CSKY in GCC's local register allocation and its naive instruction
	 selector though there is a post-isel phase to combine multiple simple
	 instructions into a more sophisticated form.
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>Senior Software Engineer: June 2017-Dec 2017, Alibaba Taobao BU. </b></br>
	 I worked there to design a static analyzer for C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++
	 based on Clang, which is widely used for statically validating the correctness
     and ensuring the robustness of Taobao App (the most popular online shopping
     application in China).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Software Engineer Intern: June 2016-August 2016, Alibaba Group. </b></br>
	 During the summer 2016, I interned at Alibaba Group to develop a prototype
	 (so-called StaticJS) that optimizes the performance of Google V8 JavaScript
	 Virtual Machine. That is, StaticJS annotates program variables with type
	 information and then passes the type information to the middle-end
	 optimizations and code generation. As such, StaticJS avoids the drawbacks of
	 dynamic typing in JavaScript to some extent and achieves higher performance
	 transparently.

<summary><strong>Software Package</strong></summary>
</br>
<b><a href="https://gitlab.com/JianpingZeng/BarGraphGenerator">BarGraphGenerator</a>: an easy-to-use bar graph generator.</b></br></br>
I have developed a bar graph generator written in Python 3 by leveraging
Matplotlib. With input plain text file provided, it generates various bar
graphs, e.g., simple bar graph, cluster graph, stacked graph, and stacked
cluster graph with option specified in the input file. Please see the example
files under the examples directory. All of these bar graphs in my published
papers are plotted by this tool! </br></br>

This project was inspired by Derek Bruening's bargraph tool. However, this tool
is dependent on GNU libraries which have some compatible issues with MacOS and
modern Linux distributions. More importantly, his tool is written in perl which
is not friendly to use and maintain in my end.</br></br>

I try to response to these inquiries about how to use my tool in a best effort
manner but can not promise that. Obviously, bug fix and patching requrests are
welcome!

<summary><strong>For Fun</strong></summary><br>
<p>
When I was a graduate student at HUST, I have been developing a research
compiler, <a href="https://github.com/JianpingZeng/xcc-project">XCC</a> written
in Java for fun and learning purpose. This compiler accepts the LLVM-3
compatible bitcode as an input and generates assembly code for x86 and ARMv7
ISA. XCC can work together with dragonegg-3.0 and LLVM 3.0 to generate binaries
for SPEC CPU2006 programs. Notably, LLVM 3.0 just provides some interfaces to
dragonegg for translating C/C++ source code into LLVM IR which is fed back to
<b>XCC</b> to generate assembly code.  </p>
